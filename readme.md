# Visualizing 2D fitting with Keras

I saw the following slide in the `MIT 6.S191: Convolutional Neural Networks` lesson, and wondered how it would work if we could actually fit a neural net to the points from the slide:

	 ![slide](slide.jpg "Slide").
	 
First I created the point sets `green_points.json` and `red_points.json` with a small HTML utitlity where I recorded points clicked.

	 ![points](red_green.png "Slide").

Then I created # Fit2DPoints_MITLessonSlide
